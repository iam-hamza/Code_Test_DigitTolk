Controller Improvement
In my opinon booking controller should be break down in to two controllers beacuse:
 # To keep the controller size short
 #  For the Booking controller to act like a resourceController
 # Coustom Controller distinct and separate responsibilities


I have also not touched the notification related function as per my opinon and code organixation these should be not in the Bookingclass
Validation class are not created but used as for refrence validation code is removed from repositry as well considring that the validation will be done in the validation class

Index function 
# Improved Documentation (This is added through out the Controller )
#  Improved Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) created two new methods isAdminOrSuperAdmin() determineAction() (In my opinon this methods should not be in the controller they should be in the trait or these logics should be manage in the middlware.)
# Using Config rather then env 
# Used json responce
Show Function 
 # Route Model Binding: making your code cleaner and more efficient.
 # Exception Handling: A try-catch block has been added to catch any exceptions that might occur during the job retrieval process. This ensures that the API provides a meaningful error response when something goes wrong.
 # Not Found Handling: If the job with the given ID is not found, it returns a 404 error response with a descriptive message.
 Update Function and Store Function
 # Added Validation class
 #  Exception Handeled
DistanceFeed Function
 # making it shorter and more readable 
 # using srp concept 
 # used tanrary opreator 

Repositry Improvement
getUsersJobs function (i firmly belive that these function should be further divided into the traits or some class for better code organiztion)
 #The method is broken down into smaller private methods,
 #Validation is added to check the user type, and if it's not recognized, a default value of 'unknown' is set.
 #The logic for getting emergency and normal jobs is separated into their respective methods.
 #The filtering logic is extracted into a separate private method for better code organization.

Store function (Assuming the route is already in the auth and role check i have removed the coustomer type check if )
 # code is highly readable and maintainable now
 # Validation is already handeled in request class rules 

storeJobEmail function (this can further be improved by considring factores like validation and SRP)
 #Variable names are in camelCase for consistency.
 #We use the null coalescing operator (??) for setting default values when a key is not present in the input array.
 #Improved comments to describe each step of the function.
 #Simplified the conditional logic for determining the email and name.

Further Improvement 
 Code can be further more organied and refactor if we introduce helpers function plus the localization. Including traits middlware is also the best way to make it more maintainnable 

Note 
I have not refactored all the repositry function i have tried to do as many as i can beacuse of shortage of time
